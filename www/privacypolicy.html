                                    <br><br>
                                    ----
                                    <br><br>                                    
                                    SECTION 1 - WHAT DO I DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?
                                    <br><br>
                                    When you visit my site I collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When you browse my site, I also automatically receive your computerâ€™s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide me with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, I may send you emails about our site, new products and other updates.
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    SECTION 2 - CONSENT
                                    <br><br>
                                    How do you get my consent?
                                    <br><br>
                                    When you provide me with personal information via the contact form, you imply that you consent to my collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
                                    <br><br>
                                    If I ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, I will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    How do I withdraw my consent?
                                    <br><br>
                                    If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting me at brice@bricewalker.com or mailing us at: Brice Walker 8119 29th Avenue Ct S, Apartment J, Lakewood, WA, 98499, United States
                                    <br><br>

                                    SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE
                                    <br><br>
                                    I may disclose your personal information if am are required by law to do so or if you violate omy Terms of Service.
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    In general, the third-party providers such as Google Analytics used by me will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, certain third-party service providers have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
                                    <br><br>
                                    For these providers, I recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Once you leave my siteâ€™s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our websiteâ€™s Terms of Service.
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                    Links
                                    <br><br>
                                    When you click on links on my site, they may direct you away from our site. I am not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.

                                    SECTION 6 - SECURITY
                                    <br><br>
                                    To protect your personal information, I take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.
                                    <br><br>
